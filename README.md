# agora-web-broadcast-demo
A simple implementation of a live broadcast web-app using the [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io) [Web SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/index.html). This code implements a "one to many" live broadcasting web-app similar to Facebook, and Youtube Live. The web-app will allow a single broadcaster to stream their video feed to a multi-person audience. This project can be extended to support "many to many" broadcasting, where multiple broadcasters are streaming to the same audience.

## Pre Requisites
- A simple web server (I use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html))
- An SSL cert or way to have an https connection (I use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com))
- A developer account with [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io)
- An understanding of HTML/CSS/JS 
- An understand of how Bootstrap and JQuery function _(minimal knowledge needed)_
